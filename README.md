# Image-Classification-ML
A simple project demonstrating image classification using PyTorch and TensorFlow on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

I wanted an opportunity to work with both TensorFlow and PyTorch to familiarize myself with them, but also to compare the two.

This repo serves as a database for me to reference.

This project is for personal studies and is mainly for tinkering.

I'm currently working on training methods, my first simple training on PyTorch (1 Epoch) yielded a 59% accuracy upon testing.

The second round of training (5 Epoch) on PyTorch yielded better results at roughly 79%.

I will continue to train and work with both models and update the repo over time.
